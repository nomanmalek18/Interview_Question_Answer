                <p>
                    HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web
                    pages.

                    set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables.

                    artists and 3D modelers should use at least 1360 x 768 resolution. However, 1920 x 1080 resolution
                    is
