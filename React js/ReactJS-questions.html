                <p>
                    Reactjs is an open source Javascript library used for building interfaces. It focuses on Creating
                    dynamic interactive web applications by allowing developers to create reusable UI components React
                    is used to build single-page applications.

                <p>Dynamic routing in React refers to the process of creating routes based on dynamic data or
                    parameters. Instead of defining static routes explicitly, dynamic routing allows you to generate
                    routes dynamically based on certain conditions or data.</p>

                    The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of the World Wide Web, and is used to load
                    webpages using hypertext links. HTTP is an application layer protocol designed to transfer
                    information between networked devices and runs on top of other layers of the network protocol stack.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    The main difference between the real DOM and the virtual DOM is that the real DOM is the browser's
                    representation of a web page, while the virtual DOM is a programming concept that helps make updates
                    to the DOM more efficient:

                <p><b>Real DOM:</b></p>
                <p>
                    Also known as the actual DOM, the real DOM is the browser's representation of a web page's HTML
                    structure. When a user interacts with a web page, the browser updates the real DOM and re-renders
                    the page to display the changes.
                </p>
                <p><b>Virtual DOM:</b></p>
                <p>
                    The virtual DOM is a programming concept that creates a "virtual" representation of a user interface
                    in memory. It's synchronized with the browser's DOM via a library. The virtual DOM is updated to
                    reflect changes made by a user, and then the changes are applied to the real DOM in a batch process.

                    19. How to create components in React?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Hey there! To create components in React, you first need to understand that components are the building blocks of a React application. Here's a simple guide to creating components in React:

                        1. **Functional Components**:
                        - The simplest way to create a component in React is by using a functional component. You can define a component as a JavaScript function that returns JSX (a syntax extension for JavaScript).
                        - Here's an example of a functional component:
                            ```jsx
                            import React from 'react';

                            const MyComponent = () => {
                            return <div>Hello, I'm a functional component!</div>;
                            };

                            export default MyComponent;
                            ```

                        2. **Class Components**:
                        - Another way to create components in React is by using class components. Class components are ES6 classes that extend from `React.Component`.
                        - Here's an example of a class component:
                            ```jsx
                            import React, { Component } from 'react';

                            class MyComponent extends Component {
                            render() {
                                return <div>Hello, I'm a class component!</div>;
                            }
                            }

                            export default MyComponent;
                            ```

                        3. **Using Components**:
                        - Once you've created a component, you can use it in other parts of your application by importing it and including it in your JSX.
                        - For example, if you have a component named `MyComponent`, you can use it like this:
                            ```jsx
                            import React from 'react';
                            import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

                            const App = () => {
                            return (
                                <div>
                                <h1>My React App</h1>
                                <MyComponent />
                                </div>
                            );
                            };

                            export default App;
                            ```

                        Remember, components in React follow a unidirectional data flow, where data flows from parent components to child components. This helps in creating modular and reusable code in your React applications. Hope this helps you get started with creating components in React! Let me know if you have any more questions.

                    20. When to use a Class Component over a Function Component?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    In React, the choice between using a class component and a functional component depends on your specific needs.
                </p>
                <p><b>Class Components:-</b></p>
                <p><b>Complex State Management:</b></p>
                <p>
                    If your component requires intricate state management, including multiple state variables, complex state updates, or derived state, class components provide a clear structure for handling these scenarios.
                </p>

                <p><b>Lifecycle Methods:</b></p>
                <p>
                    When you need to perform actions at specific points in a component's lifecycle, such as mounting, updating, or unmounting, class components offer lifecycle methods like <mark>componentDidMount</mark>, <mark>componentDidUpdate</mark>, and <mark>componentWillUnmount</mark>.
                </p>

                <p><b>Error Boundaries:</b></p>
                <p>To catch and handle errors that occur within a component's child components, you need to use a class component with the <mark>componentDidCatch</mark> lifecycle method.</p>

                <p><b>Functional Components (with Hooks):-</b></p>

                <p><b>Simpler Syntax:</b></p>
                <p>
                    Functional components have a more concise and readable syntax, especially with the introduction of Hooks. They are easier to write and understand, particularly for smaller components.
                </p>

                <p><b>Better Performance:</b></p>
                <p>Functional components can be slightly more performant than class components, especially in large-scale applications. This is because they avoid the overhead of creating class instances.</p>

                <p><b>Easier to Test:</b></p>
                <p>Functional components are generally easier to test due to their simpler structure and reliance on props.</p>

                <p><b>Code Reusability:</b></p>
                <p>With custom Hooks, you can extract and reuse logic across different functional components, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

                    21. What are Pure Components?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    a pure component is a class-based component that automatically skips re-rendering when the props and state of the component don't change. This helps to optimize performance by reducing unnecessary updates. 
                </p>

                    22. What is the state in React?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The state is a built-in React object that is used to contain data or information about the component. A component's state can change over time; whenever it changes, the component re-renders.
                </p>
            </div>

                    23. What are props in React?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    props (short for properties) are a way to pass data from a parent component to its child components. They are like arguments that you pass to a function
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="question-24">
                <h3>24. What is the difference between state and props?</h3>
                <p>
                    the main difference between props and state is that the props are a way to pass the data or properties from one component to other components while the state is the real-time data available to use within only that component.  
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="question-25">
                <h3>25. Why should we not update the state directly?</h3>
                <p>
                    React may not detect the change, and your component might not re-render as expected. 
                </p>

            <div class="question-26">
                <h3>26. What is the purpose of the callback function as an argument of setState()?</h3>
                <p>
                    the callback function provided as an argument to setState() is used to execute code after the state has been updated and the component has re-rendered, allowing you to perform actions that depend on the new state value, particularly when dealing with asynchronous operations like network requests or updating multiple state values in sequence.

                <p>
                    The primary difference between HTML and React event handling is that in HTML, event handlers are directly written as strings within the HTML element, while in React, event handlers are JavaScript functions passed as attributes to the element, using camelCase naming conventions instead of lowercase, allowing for more complex logic within the event handler due to React's component-based structure and state management capabilities.
