                <h3>1. What is a javascript</h3>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically and interactive website
                    and
                    updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="question-2">
                <h3>2. how to fetch html elements</h3>
                <p>
                    You can use the <strong>getElementsByClassName()</strong> method to access elements by their class
                    name.
                    You can also use the <strong>querySelector()</strong> method to select an element based on its CSS
                    selector. The most common way to access an element is by using its ID, with the
                    <strong>getElementById()</strong> method.
                </p>

                <h3>3. what is a variables</h3>
                <p>
                    A JavaScript variable is simply a name of storage location. There are two types of variables in
                    JavaScript : local variable and global variable. There are some rules while declaring a JavaScript
                    variable (also known as identifiers). Name must start with a letter (a to z or A to Z), underscore(
                    _ ),
                    or dollar( $ ) sign.
                </p>

                <h3>4. how many datatypes of javascript primitive and non primitive</h3>
                <p><b>Primitive Data Types (7):</b></p>

                <p>
                    <b>string:</b> Represents textual data.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>number:</b> Represents numeric values (integers and floating-point).
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>bigint:</b> Represents integers of arbitrary length.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>boolean:</b> Represents logical values (true or false).
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>undefined:</b> Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>null:</b> Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
                </p>

                <p> 
                    <b>symbol:</b> Represents unique and immutable values.
                </p>

                <p><b> Non-Primitive Data Type (1):</b></p>
                <p>
                    <b>object:</b> Represents a collection of key-value pairs. Arrays, functions, and dates are also considered
                    objects in JavaScript.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="question-5">
                <h3>5. array and object</h3>
                <p><b>Arrays and objects are both used to store data, but they differ in how they store it and how they are used:</b></p>
                
                <p><b>Arrays:-</b></p>
                <p>
                    Used to store a list of elements with the same data type or structure. Arrays store data in consecutive memory locations and use numbered indexes. For example, an array of numbers can be declared using square brackets. 
                </p>

                <p><b>Objects:-</b></p>
                <p>
                    Used to group multiple sets of data that belong together. Objects store data in named key-value pairs and use named indexes. For example, an object can be declared using curly brackets. 
                </p>

                <p><b>differences between arrays and objects:-</b></p>
                <p>Properties: Objects tend to use names for their properties, while arrays use numbers starting from 0</p>
                <p>Values: Arrays usually contain varying amounts of conceptually identical values.</p>
                <p>Methods: Methods are functions that live in properties and act on the value of which they are a property.</p>
                <p>Iteration: You can iterate over arrays using a special kind of for loop.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="question-6">
                <h3>6. what is hoisting in javascript</h3>
                <p>
                    Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution. This means that you can use a variable or function before it's declared in your code.
                </p>
                <p><b>Important Points:</b></p>
                <p>
                    <b>Only Declarations are Hoisted:</b> While the declaration is hoisted, the assignment (initialization) is not.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Function Declarations vs. Function Expressions:</b> Function declarations are hoisted completely, allowing you to call them before they are defined. Function expressions (assigned to a variable) are not hoisted in the same way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>var vs. let and const:</b> Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their scope and initialized with undefined. Variables declared with let and const are also hoisted, but they are not initialized. Accessing them before declaration results in a ReferenceError
                </p>

                <h3>8. what is a callback function</h3>
                <p>
                    a callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after the first function has completed its task. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="question-9">
                <h3>9. what is promises</h3>
                <p>
                    a Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

                <h3>11. Javascript is a typed language.</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes, JavaScript is a typed language, but it's considered weakly typed or dynamically typed
                </p>
            </div>

                <h3>15. What are the following looping structures available in javascripts?</h3>
                <p>
                    <b>for loop:</b> This is the most common loop, used when you know the exact number of iterations in advance.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>while loop:</b> This loop executes as long as a specified condition is true.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>do...while loop:</b> Similar to the while loop, but it executes the code block at least once before checking the condition.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>for...in loop:</b> This loop iterates over the enumerable properties of an object.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>for...of loop:</b> This loop iterates over the values of iterable objects (arrays, strings, maps, sets, etc.).

                <h3>16. What is the meaning of the "this" keyword in javascript?</h3>
                <p>
                    the this keyword refers to the object that is currently executing the code. Its value is determined by how a function is called.
