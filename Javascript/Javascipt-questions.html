            <h3>1. What is a javascript</h3>
            <p>
                JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically and interactive website and
                updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else.

            <h3>2. how to fetch html elements</h3>
            <p>
                You can use the <strong>getElementsByClassName()</strong> method to access elements by their class name.
                You can also use the <strong>querySelector()</strong> method to select an element based on its CSS
                selector. The most common way to access an element is by using its ID, with the
                <strong>getElementById()</strong> method.
            </p>

                variable (also known as identifiers). Name must start with a letter (a to z or A to Z), underscore( _ ),
                or dollar( $ ) sign.
